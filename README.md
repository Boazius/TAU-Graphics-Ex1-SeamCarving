<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project
Exercise 1,  As part of the ["Fundamentals of Computer Graphics, Vision and Image Processing"](https://www.ims.tau.ac.il/Tal/Syllabus/Syllabus_L.aspx?course=0368323601&year=2022) course in Tel aviv university (2022). <br>
Made by [Boaz Yakubov](https://github.com/Boazius/) and [Noga Kinor](https://github.com/nogakinor)

Content-aware image resizing changes the image resolution while maintaining the aspect ratio of important regions - This is different from simple stretching or shrinking of the image, since it intelligently avoids impacting "important" areas of the image, and instead modifies the least important areas of the image (typically the background)

For example, for an image like this (1920x1080): 

<img src="imagesInput\camel.jpg" alt="alt_text" style="width:50%" />

if we wanted to resize it to 1500x1100 , we must find the "unimportant" areas - horizontal marked in black and vertical marked in red:

<img src="imagesOutput\cameltime_horizontal_seams.png" alt="alt_text" style="width:50%" />
<img src="imagesOutput\cameltime_vertical_seams.png" alt="alt_text" style="width:50%" />

and then delete these unimportant areas in the image to get the final resized image

<img src="imagesOutput\cameltime_resized.png" alt="alt_text" style="width:50%" />

Note that the camels were not resized at all! only the background sky and desert was shrunk.

#### _in order to enlarge the image using this technique, we would simply duplicate these lines instead_

### This program performs image resizing using this technique on a specified image, and outputs:
- the resized image
- the original image with horizontal black lines (that will be deleted or duplicated)
- the _the partially resized_ image with vertical red lines (that will be deleted or duplicated)

#### The program optionally uses a "forward looking energy function" instead of the regular energy function, in order to reduce artifacts in the resized image

## Mathematical Background

In order to implement the Seam carving algorithm, we need to define an energy function that specifies the "importance" of each image pixel. we can calculate the pixel importance using the image gradient.

We computed it using the formula 
$E(i,j) =  \sqrt{\frac{{(\Delta_x)^2 + (\Delta_y)^2}}{2}} $
where $\Delta_x^2$ is the squared difference between the current and next horizontal pixel (in grayscale) and $\Delta_y^2$ is the same for vertical pixels

to find the optimal "Seams" to remove or duplicate , i.e the lines along the image:

- calculate the cost matrix M
- do k times:
    - find a path with the lowest total energy from one end of the image to the other.
    - delete or duplicate it


to resize the image both horizontally and vertically, we first change the width using the algorith and then the height on the partially resized image.

### Forward Looking energy function
Seam carving can introduce artifacts to the resized images. to reduce these artifacts, we implement a forward-looking energy function:

$M(i,j) = E(i,j) + \min\begin{cases}
M(i-1,j-1)+C_L(i,j), \\
M(i-1,j)+C_V(i,j) \\
M(i-1,j+1) + C_R(i,j)
\end{cases} $

where ($I_gs$ is the grayscale image) 

$C_L = |I_gs(i,j+1)-I_gs(i,j-1)|+|I_gs(i-1,j)-I_gs(i,j-1)|$

$C_V = |I_gs(i,j+1)-I_gs(i,j-1)|$

$C_R = |I_gs(i,j+1)-I_gs(i,j-1)|+|I_gs(i-1,j)-I_gs(i,j+1)|$

when using the program, you can choose to use the previous energy function, or this forward looking energy function.
