# SeamCarvingEx1Tau

Seam Carving
Deadline: 11/4/2022 
Tel aviv University computer graphics course 2022 exercise 1

Introduction
Content-aware image resizing changes the image resolution while maintaining the aspect ratio
of important regions. In this exercise, you will implement and explore image resizing using the
seam carving algorithm and other basic image processing operations.
You are provided with a basic skeleton project which supports the following features:
• It resizes an input image using simple nearest-neighbor interpolation
• It outputs the image gradients
You need to extend the provided project and support the following features:
• Image resizing via basic seam carving algorithm with a given energy function
• Image resizing via seam carving algorithm with forward energy looking energy function
Your program should output the following:
• Resized image with the specified output dimension
• If seam carving method is chosen, you will also output visualization images with the
chosen seams colored in red and black for horizontal and vertical seams, respectively.
See next section for further details.
